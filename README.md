Nougat presented some new challenges for the S4. One of those challenges was that the camera could take pictures, but not record video.

Here is my workaround for that. The usual methods did not work, so I leveraged su (root) to do a low level recording. You can choose 1 minute or 3 minute recordings. There is no audio at this time. The record button records a video. The picture button takes a photo. All files are saved in the /sdcard/Pictures folder.

Changelog:
20161227
+ Version 0.9
+ Now can stop recording or use timer. No audio yet.

20161222
+ Version 0.8
+ Records video and takes pictures. No audio yet.

20161220
+ Takes a photo.
